    Nike SB Dunk Low Pro x Riot Skateshop
    Mahogany and Team Red</h1>
<p>

 <br>
    A proud city whose dedication to authenticity is recognised worldwide, the Dunk Low Pro x Riot Skateshop incorporates regional aesthetics from Bordeaux's rich winemaking history through custom details and finishes.
    <hr>

    Using a Mahogany leather upper with deep tonal reds and black nubuck underlays, its translucent red-tinged sole reveals a homage to the grapes that create Bordeaux's unmistakable flavour profile. <br>The wine theme continues with gradient cork insole artwork, wax-seal tongue logos and debossed heel branding. As a finishing touch, this special design offers an ode to their departed shop sentinel with an illustrated embroidered heel logo.</p>
